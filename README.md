This is where I will keep my ZenScript and JSON recipe scripts for use with CraftTweaker and CreateTweaker which are both dependencies to be able to use all the scripts here. For those who are better suited with JSON only, then please feel free to rewrite into pure JSON and use OpenLoader.

There is also code for modifying the vanilla Create recipes and material utilization with renewable materials. I aim to make the renewable recipes as realistic as possible considering the composition of elements as well.

I am by no means an expert, but I think I've made enough recipes to no longer be considered a beginner. 

Speaking of beginners, I highly recommend CraftTweaker as it has made implementing custom recipes, durability and other things much easier! You may use my work as a point of reference along with CraftTweaker's documentation to help you get started if you want to make your own modpack, either to enjoy with friends privately or publish publicly once you learn the strings.
