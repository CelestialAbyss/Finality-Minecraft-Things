# Hi there!
This is where I will keep my ZenScript and JSON recipe scripts for use with CraftTweaker and CreateTweaker exclusively.
There is also code for modifying the vanilla Create recipes and material utilization with renewable materials.

I aim to make the renewable recipes as realistic as possible considering the composition of elements as well.
