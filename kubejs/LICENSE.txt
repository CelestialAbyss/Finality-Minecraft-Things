### License clarifications
Finality is released on CurseForge only as **All Rights Reserved.**
This covers the following files / folders.
* All FTB Quests, their Rewards and arrangement in `\instance\config\ftbquests\quests`
* All custom KubeJS scripts and assets in `\instance\kubejs\`
* All custom Finality FancyMenu assets in `\instance\resources`
  * This also applies to customizations made with DrippyLoadingScreen and FancyMenu
* All customizations in `instance\resourcepacks\Finality Customizations\assets`
  * The custom menu music I have implemented in `Finality Customizations\assets\sounds\music\menu` is NOT ours, however. The terms for Cjbeards's work can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZTM7nf4Uia19c-NQheqPnLAk1Bs6NS6XZiLt7Mk4Z1Q/edit#gid=0
  * Custom retextures are a work in progress, but they are still considered ours and the authors of the original texture assets.

### What does this mean?
* For regular players, this does not mean anything other than **don't steal or repost without explicit permission from ClestialAbyss or Ryanite AKA Skensian on GitHub**. You are still permitted to play, film and stream the pack. If you want to make your own modpack, please feel free to look at the code and use it as a reference along with KubeJS's documents.
* For others, **you are prohibited from redistributing any of the above folders or files in any publicly released packs without permission from us unless explicitly stated.**
